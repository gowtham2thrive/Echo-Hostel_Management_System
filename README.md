## 🛡️ Staff Portal
*A powerful command center for hostel administration.*

### 1. Complaint Management Board
* **AI Insight Panel:** Instantly analyzes hundreds of pending complaints to generate a **Root Cause Analysis** summary (e.g., *"Multiple reports of low voltage on 2nd floor"*), allowing staff to fix the core issue rather than treating symptoms.
* **Priority Feed:** Complaints are auto-sorted into **Critical**, **Medium**, and **Low** priority queues using interactive filter chips.
* **Bulk Actions:** High-efficiency tools to **Acknowledge All** or **Resolve All** complaints in a specific category with a single click.
* **PDF Reporting:** One-click generation of professional vector PDF reports for official audits and meetings.

### 2. Outing & Security Control
* **Live Dashboard:** A real-time list of **"Currently Out"** students with countdown timers for overdue returns.
* **One-Tap Check-In:** Instantly mark students as returned to close their gate pass.
* **Visual Analytics:** Interactive bar charts visualizing outing trends (Weekly/Monthly) to monitor student movement patterns.

### 3. Student Directory & Approvals
* **Digital Directory:** Searchable database of all registered students with contact details (Phone / Parent Phone).
* **Approval Workflow:** Review and approve/reject new student registrations and profile update requests.
* **Strict Validation:** Prevents unauthorized changes to sensitive data (like Roll Numbers) without staff oversight.
